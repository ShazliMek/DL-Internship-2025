Day 1:

About Myself:

Hi! I'm Shazli Mekrani, a Computer Science student at Western University with a minor in Software Engineering. I’m passionate about building real-world software solutions and have experience in full-stack development, AI/ML projects, and systems programming. My portfolio includes projects ranging from face detection apps to blockchain-integrated fraud detection systems. I'm excited to apply my skills and expand my knowledge in deep learning during this internship.

Concept Summary:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad area in computer science that aims to create machines capable of mimicking human intelligence. It includes everything from logic-based systems to advanced algorithms that make decisions and learn from data.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms use statistical techniques to find patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.

Deep Learning (DL) is a specialized branch of ML that uses neural networks with many layers. It excels at handling large-scale unstructured data such as images, speech, and natural language. DL models learn hierarchies of features automatically, enabling breakthroughs in fields like computer vision and language modeling.

What I aim to gain for this internship:

Gain a deep understanding of deep learning foundations and architectures, Build multiple end-to-end DL projects using real-world datasets
, Get hands-on experience with tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, Learn to document and showcase AI/DL projects professionally on GitHub, Explore areas like CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and generative models. as i bonus i might get an idea for my startup


Day 2:

Summary of Tasks
Reviewed Python basics: variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, loops, if-else, functions, and a basic intro to classes.

Practiced all concepts with hands-on examples in Google Colab.

Explored NumPy for array creation, indexing, reshaping, and mean/sum operations.

Worked with Pandas to read a real Apple stock CSV, clean it, and analyze it using head/tail, filtering, and describe().

Added 3 mini tasks using NumPy & Pandas:

✅ Calculated daily price range using NumPy.

✅ Filtered rows where close > 150.

✅ Computed average closing price.
