1) What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science focused on creating machines or systems that can mimic human intelligence. This includes reasoning, learning, problem-solving, understanding language, and perception.


2) How is Machine Learning (ML) different from Deep Learning (DL)?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where algorithms are trained to make predictions or decisions based on data. It involves manual feature extraction and simpler models like decision trees or support vector machines.

Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). It automatically extracts features and is especially powerful for handling unstructured data like images, audio, and text.

3) Real-World Applications of Each:
Field	Applications
AI	- Chatbots (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
      Self-driving cars
      Fraud detection
ML	- Spam email filtering
      Product recommendations
      Stock price prediction
DL	- Facial recognition
      Language translation
      Medical image analysis
