Day 1:

About Myself:

Hi! I'm Shazli Mekrani, a Computer Science student at Western University with a minor in Software Engineering. I’m passionate about building real-world software solutions and have experience in full-stack development, AI/ML projects, and systems programming. My portfolio includes projects ranging from face detection apps to blockchain-integrated fraud detection systems. I'm excited to apply my skills and expand my knowledge in deep learning during this internship.

What I aim to gain for this internship:

Gain a deep understanding of deep learning foundations and architectures, Build multiple end-to-end DL projects using real-world datasets
, Get hands-on experience with tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, Learn to document and showcase AI/DL projects professionally on GitHub, Explore areas like CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and generative models. as i bonus i might get an idea for my startup


Day 2:

Summary of Tasks
Reviewed Python basics: variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, loops, if-else, functions, and a basic intro to classes.

Practiced all concepts with hands-on examples in Google Colab.

Explored NumPy for array creation, indexing, reshaping, and mean/sum operations.

Worked with Pandas to read a real Apple stock CSV, clean it, and analyze it using head/tail, filtering, and describe().

Added 3 mini tasks using NumPy & Pandas:

✅ Calculated daily price range using NumPy.

✅ Filtered rows where close > 150.

✅ Computed average closing price.
