1) What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science focused on creating machines or systems that can mimic human intelligence. This includes reasoning, learning, problem-solving, understanding language, and perception.


2) How is Machine Learning (ML) different from Deep Learning (DL)?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where algorithms are trained to make predictions or decisions based on data. It involves manual feature extraction and simpler models like decision trees or support vector machines.

Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). It automatically extracts features and is especially powerful for handling unstructured data like images, audio, and text.

3) Real-World Applications of Each:
Field	Applications
AI	- Chatbots (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
      Self-driving cars
      Fraud detection
ML	- Spam email filtering
      Product recommendations
      Stock price prediction
DL	- Facial recognition
      Language translation
      Medical image analysis

About Myself:

Hi! I'm Shazli Mekrani, a Computer Science student at Western University with a minor in Software Engineering. Iâ€™m passionate about building real-world software solutions and have experience in full-stack development, AI/ML projects, and systems programming. My portfolio includes projects ranging from face detection apps to blockchain-integrated fraud detection systems. I'm excited to apply my skills and expand my knowledge in deep learning during this internship.

What I aim to gain for this internship:

Gain a deep understanding of deep learning foundations and architectures, Build multiple end-to-end DL projects using real-world datasets
, Get hands-on experience with tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, Learn to document and showcase AI/DL projects professionally on GitHub, Explore areas like CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and generative models. as i bonus i might get an idea for my startup
